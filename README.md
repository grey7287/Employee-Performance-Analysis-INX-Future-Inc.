## Analysis:

Random Forest with RandomSearch gives 95% accuracy.

The features that are positively correlated are Environment Satisfaction, Last Salary Hike Percent & Worklife Balance. This means that if these factors increases, Performance Rating will increase. On the other hand, the features that are negatively correlated are Years Since Last Promotion, Experience Years at this Company, Experience years in Current Role & Years with Current Manager. This means that if these factors increases, Performance Rating will go down.

The top 3 features effecting employee performances are: 
1) Employee Environment Satisfaction 
2) Employee Last Salary Hike Percent 
3) Years since last promotion

### Conclusion based on insights from analysis:

We can conclude that the company should provide a better environment for the employees as it increases the performance drastically. The company should increase the salary of the employee from time to time and help them maintain a worklife balance. On the other hand, shuffling the manager from time to time will also affect performance.
